# RxJS 5

Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript. This is a rewrite of [Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and is the latest production-ready version of RxJS. This rewrite is meant to have better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.

## Installation and Usage

### ES6 via npm

```sh
npm install rxjs
```

To import the entire core set of functionality:

```js
import Rx from 'rxjs/Rx';

Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3)
```

To import only what you need by patching (this is useful for size-sensitive bundling):

```js
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
import 'rxjs/add/observable/of';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';

Observable.of(1,2,3).map(x => x + '!!!'); // etc
```

To import what you need and use it with proposed [bind operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bind-operator):

> Note: This additional syntax requires [transpiler support](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-function-bind/) and this syntax may be completely withdrawn from TC39 without notice! Use at your own risk.

```js
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';
import { of } from 'rxjs/observable/of';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operator/map';

Observable::of(1,2,3)::map(x => x + '!!!'); // etc
```

### CommonJS via npm

To install this library for CommonJS (CJS) usage, use the following command:

```sh
npm install rxjs
```

Import all core functionality:

```js
var Rx = require('rxjs/Rx');

Rx.Observable.of(1,2,3); // etc
```

Import only what you need and patch Observable (this is useful in size-sensitive bundling scenarios)
